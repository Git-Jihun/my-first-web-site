<h1>CSS란 무엇인가?</h1>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs.en.html" target="_blank" title="CSS specification">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is a simple mechanism for adding style (e.g., fonts, colors, spacing) to Web documents.
<p>
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
