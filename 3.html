<h1>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h1>
<a href="https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/javascript.php" target="_blank" title="JavaScript specification">JavaScript</a> is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language developed by Netscape.
JavaScript was created by Netscape programmer Brendan Eich.
<p>
It was first released under the name of LiveScript as part of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995. It was renamed JavaScript on December 4, 1995. As JavaScript works on the client side, It is mostly used for client-side web development.
</p>
<p>
JavaScript is designed for use on web pages and closely integrated with HTML. JavaScript can create applications which run in the browsers such as IE, Opera, FireFox, Google Chrome and other. Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International for standardization resulting in the standardized version named ECMAScript.
